# Bike Rental Shop Analysis Using SQL - Business Case Study

## Project Description:
In this project, a local bike rental shop owner, Emily, required data insights to help grow her business. The analysis involved querying a SQL database containing data on bikes, rentals, customers, and memberships. The objective was to extract meaningful information related to bike inventory, rental revenue, membership purchases, and customer segmentation. This case study involved writing complex SQL queries to provide Emily with insights into her business operations and performance.

## Execution:
### 1. Data Modeling:
a. Designed relational data models to establish connections between tables, including bikes, rentals, customers, and memberships.

b. Implemented primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity and create relationships between different tables (e.g., rentals linked with customers and bikes, memberships tied to membership types and customers).

### 2.Inventory Analysis:
a. Developed queries to count the number of bikes by category, showing only categories with more than two bikes.

b. Segregated bike statuses (available, rented, out of service) to provide insights into bike availability and utilization rates.

### 3.Revenue and Pricing Analytics:
a. Calculated the total rental revenue per month, year, and across all years using SQL aggregate functions, providing a comprehensive sales report.
b. Applied business logic to compute new discounted rental prices for different bike categories during seasonal offers.
c. Generated reports on the total revenue from memberships for each combination of year, month, and membership type, providing data for pricing strategies.

### 4.Customer Segmentation:
a. Categorized customers based on rental frequency into three segments: 'more than 10 rentals,' 'between 5 and 10 rentals,' and 'fewer than 5 rentals.'
b. Developed SQL queries using GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to calculate the number of customers in each rental category.

### 5.Membership Insights:
a. Queried customer membership data to generate a list of customers with the total number of memberships purchased, providing insights for customer loyalty programs.
b. Provided detailed breakdowns of revenue generated by membership types across various time periods, helping to evaluate the success of membership programs.

### 6.Optimization Techniques:
a. Used indexed queries to optimize performance, ensuring efficient retrieval of large datasets and reducing query execution time.
b. Employed aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), and conditional logic (CASE) to address complex queries related to rental and membership revenue analysis.

### Project Summary:
This SQL case study focused on analyzing and optimizing business operations for a bike rental shop through detailed database querying and data modeling. Key insights included categorization of bike inventory, rental revenue trends, pricing strategies, and customer segmentation. The project demonstrated advanced SQL skills in data extraction, aggregation, and analysis, helping the business owner make informed decisions to improve operational efficiency and revenue growth.
